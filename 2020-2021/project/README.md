# Project

Write your code in tasks.hs. You can add other modules aswell, but the checker should be able to find the functions required for each task in module Tasks. Make sure none of your modules are called: Main, Utils or Dataset.

### Run checker
make run_test

### Check the output of one task
Load main.hs into ghci.
<code>
run_test taskset_number task_number [subtask_number]
</code>
